## Examples:
### Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until it's narrowed down the possible locations to just one. It requires the original list to be sorted.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort (aka mergesort)is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
1. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
